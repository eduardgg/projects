# Projects

This repository contains a selection of my personal projects, showcasing a variety of programming tasks I've worked on. These aren't necessarily the most difficult, long, or complex projects I've done, but they represent code I'm happy to share publicly at this moment as a first draft. I'll continue updating the repository over time.

The projects span across different programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, and MATLAB, organized into thematic folders based on the type of project.

## Structure

- **Algorithms and Data Structures**  
  This folder includes a variety of advanced algorithms and data structures that are useful across a wide range of problems. These are more general and not easily classified into other specific areas.  

- **Classic Problems**  
  A collection of solutions to classic, complex problems known for their beauty and challenge. Some solutions use the concepts from the "Algorithms and Data Structures" folder. It also contains more straightforward problems that are interesting to solve or have practical, real-life applications.

- **Cryptography**  
  Contains basic encryption techniques and solutions to some decryption challenges. The focus is on both theoretical and practical cryptographic problems.

- **Games**  
  This folder explores simulations of strategies for various chance-based games, as well as my implementations to efficiently solve logic-based games (e.g., Sudoku and its variants).

- **Geometry**  
  Projects focused on computational geometry, ranging from basic geometric operations to more advanced topics like mesh reconstruction. Some of the algorithms here have been optimized for better performance in specific scenarios.

- **Graph Algorithms**  
  Solutions to complex problems in the field of graph theory, with many specialized in tree structures. The folder also covers graph traversal techniques and optimizations.

- **Numerical**  
  Numerical calculus projects, primarily implemented in MATLAB. This folder includes efficient solutions for problems in numerical analysis, such as solving differential equations, interpolation, and more.

- **RFID Tags**  
  A more complex project developed using Java and NFC technology (specifically with an STMicroelectronics SDK and a hardware reader). This project implements advanced digital signature algorithms (like RSA) for authentication, later improved with elliptic curve cryptography. *(Until quantum computing disrupts everything, of course!)*

- **Watermarks**  
  A project focused on watermark removal through image overlay techniques. This was an introduction to image processing and color manipulation using Python, while familiarizing myself with the relevant libraries.
