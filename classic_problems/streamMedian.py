# Update the median of an array, streaming the values

# Given the first m numbers,
# h1 is a max heap storing the smallest m//2 values,
# and h2 is a min heap storing the largest ones.
# As we keep streaming the array's values, we insert
# them in the heaps to keep them balanced (with a
# difference of sizes <= 1), and then simply output
# the median, which will either be the maximum of h1,
# or the minimum of h2, needing only a heappop.

# Total time complexity: O(nÂ·logn)
# Total space complexity: O(n)
